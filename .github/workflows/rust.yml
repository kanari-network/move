To modify the GitHub Actions workflow to build the Rust project for Windows, you can add a new job that runs on a Windows runner (`windows-latest`). Here is an updated version of your workflow file:

```yaml
name: Rust

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always

jobs:
  build-linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --verbose
    # - name: Run tests
    #   run: cargo test --verbose

  build-windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install Rust
      run: rustup install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
    - name: Set up Rust toolchain
      run: rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --verbose
    # - name: Run tests
    #   run: cargo test --verbose
